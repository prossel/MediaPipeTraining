# MediaPipe Model Maker - Object Detection Training
# Compatible with Python 3.11 on macOS (Apple Silicon)
# 
# Installation instructions:
# Run cell 7 in the notebook - it handles installation automatically in the correct order

# JAX with compatible ml-dtypes (MUST be installed first for TensorFlow 2.15 compatibility)
jax[cpu]==0.4.20
ml-dtypes==0.2.0

# Core TensorFlow for macOS with GPU acceleration
tensorflow-macos==2.15.0
tensorflow-metal==1.1.0
tf-keras==2.15.0
tensorflow-hub==0.15.0

# MediaPipe Model Maker (installed with --no-deps to avoid conflicts)
mediapipe-model-maker==0.2.1.3

# Supporting libraries
tensorflow-datasets
numpy
pillow
opencv-python
matplotlib
scikit-learn
scipy
pycocotools
absl-py

# Note: 
# - JAX 0.4.20 with ml-dtypes 0.2.0 is compatible with TensorFlow 2.15.0
# - We skip tf-models-official because tensorflow-text 2.15.0 is not available for macOS ARM
# - mediapipe-model-maker works without tf-models-official for object detection tasks
# - Installation order matters: JAX first, then TensorFlow, then mediapipe-model-maker
